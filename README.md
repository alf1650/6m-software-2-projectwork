To fix the issue with the iso-3166 in your code, you need to update the code to use a valid JavaScript identifier for the property name. In JavaScript, identifiers cannot contain hyphens.

In this code, the item['iso-3166'] expression uses bracket notation to access the iso-3166 property of the item object. This allows you to preserve the original property name while still accessing its value in the table.
